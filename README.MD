# WS2812 1.0

This project is to demonstrate how to use multi PIO programs on RP2040. I use a Adafruit NeoPixel ring https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463 .
The PIO code is from the examples in the pico sdk and the initialise code is also from the examples, exept the allocated state machine is returned.
